# Log-Normal-Shadowing-Model
Formula to Get Shadowing Using Parameter RSSI Wi-Fi in ESP Arduino IDE

In the log-normal shadowing model, the log-normal shadowing term, denoted as X, follows a log-normal distribution. The distribution is specified by its mean (μ) and standard deviation (σ).

The notation X ~ LogNormal(μ, σ) represents that the random variable X is distributed according to a log-normal distribution with mean μ and standard deviation σ.

In the formula X = exp(μ + σ * z1), where z1 is a Gaussian random variable, the log-normal shadowing term X is generated by taking the exponential of a value obtained by adding the mean μ to the product of the standard deviation σ and a random variable z1 following a Gaussian (normal) distribution.

By adjusting the mean (μ) and standard deviation (σ) values in the log-normal distribution, you can control the characteristics of the shadowing effect in the model. Typically, the mean μ is set to 0, indicating that the log-normal shadowing term has no systematic bias, while the standard deviation σ represents the magnitude of random variations in the signal strength due to shadowing.


1. Indoor Environment: For indoor environments, where the presence of obstacles and reflections can cause significant variations in signal strength, a reasonable range for "mu" could be between -4 and 0. This range captures the typical attenuating effects of walls, furniture, and other objects.

2. Outdoor Environment: In outdoor environments with line-of-sight conditions, where obstacles are minimal, the range for "mu" could be between -2 and 2. The larger range reflects the relatively unobstructed propagation characteristics and the presence of other factors such as terrain and vegetation.

3. Specific Environments: For specific environments with unique characteristics, it's best to analyze empirical data or conduct measurements to determine the appropriate range for "mu". This analysis allows you to capture the specific shadowing effects present in your environment accurately.
